[![Build and Tag ISO](https://github.com/PandeCode/dotnix/actions/workflows/build_iso.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PandeCode/dotnix/actions/workflows/build_iso.yml)

> Very much a WIP

Building the iso fails locally so git commits beging with "build-iso" trigger and action that build the iso.
The iso genetated is about 3.7GB and github releases have a max filesize of 2GB.
So I split the iso into compatibale sizes using a prefix of ISO*PART*.

Download the files(curl, wget, axel, Direct Download)

Use cat in a POSIX compliant shell with glob support(or a manual ref).

```bash
cat ISO_PART_* > nixiso.iso
# or
cat INSTALL_ISO_PART_* > nixiso.iso
```

> Because of the nature of the files, it will trigger security in flashers like Rufus. You can ignore this.
> This setup is primarily for my personal use and _will_ break about 95% of the time with hardcoded paths and bugs that I will refuse to fix for a while. Feel free to take inspiration from it, though Iâ€™m not sure why you would want to.
