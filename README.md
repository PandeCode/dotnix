# Files for Backing Up and Reproducing My NixOS System on WSL

> Not yet complete

> **Note**: This setup is primarily for my personal use and *will* break about 95% of the time with hardcoded paths and bugs that I will refuse to fix for a while. Feel free to take inspiration from it, though Iâ€™m not sure why you would want to.

## Why NixOS?
- NixOS is the new Arch btw.
- It presents a fresh challenge and learning opportunity.
- I love the reproducibility that NixOS offers, allowing easy system restoration and version tracking.

## Why Windows?
- Some programs required for schoolwork are Windows-only, and the school does not provide licenses for more than one installation (e.g., Logger Pro, Vernier, Wolfram Player).
- Other people may need to use my computer but can't work with a WM.
- To avoid the distraction of ricing (ironically, I'm here creating a new dotfiles repo).
- Gaming is easier on Windows.
- Managing Wine can be cumbersome and has been a headache in the past.

## Why WSL?
- I am a former Linux user.
- The tooling on Windows is absoulte trash, compared to linux, especially for development.
- WSL provides a more familiar Linux-like environment.

I built this, brick by brick
